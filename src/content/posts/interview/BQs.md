# MockQuestions

## Describe a difficult project and how you overcame it.

The GPU x project was a low-level and highly complex project.==One major challenge for me was switching from **Java to C++**==, while also learning **OpenGL** and GPU-related concepts at the same time

GPU x 项目是一个非常底层、技术复杂度很高的项目。我面临的主要挑战是需要从 **Java 切换到 C++**，同时还要学习 **OpenGL** 以及 GPU 相关的底层知识。.

Since the project involved low-level graphics and performance optimization, the learning curve was steep. ==To overcome this, I actively asked experienced teammates for guidance and collected high-quality internal technical documents within the company.== I combined these resources with official documentation and hands-on experiments to gradually build my  understanding.

为了克服学习成本高的问题，我主动向周围有经验的同事请教，并整理和学习了公司内部已有的优质技术资料，同时结合官方文档和实践不断验证理解。

Through this process, I successfully adapted to C++ development and gained a much deeper understanding of low-level graphics systems and GPU optimization.

通过这个过程，我顺利完成了语言和技术栈的切换，也对底层图形系统和 GPU 优化有了更深入的认识。
